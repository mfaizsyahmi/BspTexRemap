Two files need to exist in this folder:

1. dm_hellhole.ORIGIN
   (i.e. dm_hellhole.bsp with extension changed to ORIGIN)
   (NOT INCLUDED IN DISTRIBUTION)
   (download at https://gamebanana.com/mods/59667)

2. dm_hellhole_custommat.NOPE
   (custommat file for dm_hellhole map, but with extension changed)
   (INCLUDED IN DISTRIBUTION)

If you mucked around the test_integration.py file, then set up however it's set up in the setUp method.
